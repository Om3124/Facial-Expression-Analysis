# Facial-Expression-Analysis

The Face Recognition System is an AI-powered application that utilizes Machine Learning and Python to identify and verify individuals based on facial features. It employs deep learning models like FaceNet, DeepFace, or dlib for feature extraction and classification, ensuring high accuracy. The system detects faces using OpenCV or deep learning-based techniques and then matches them against a stored database using algorithms like SVM, KNN, or CNNs. Designed for real-time processing, it can be used in various applications, including security systems, attendance tracking, and identity verification. With Python libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV, the project demonstrates the practical implementation of AI in computer vision and biometric authentication.
